# Movies
Website to lookup movies or TV shows using the OMDb API. Once you type the name it returns a list of 10 movies/shows matching it.
Clicking on any of them will take you to a page where you can see it plot, runtime, ratings, main start(and a link to check its full cast). 
It contains a link to lookup the trailer on youtube as well.
